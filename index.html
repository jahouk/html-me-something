        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Jason Houk and I've always been a
             bit of a foodie. One of my goals has always been to open my own 
             coffee shop whether that was as part of a bakery or some other 
             concept.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little more about me, I stumbled into 
            computers while living in Southern Oregon and had a good run doing 
            technical support. While in Southern Oregon I worked at a call 
            center where I did support for clients such as Disney Interactive, 
            Packard Bell Premiere Support, Apple, and Sonic Solutions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would later go on to move to the St. Louis
             area and continue my career in IT. In St. Louis I worked for the 
             Zippatoni Company and Clark Refining and Marketing as a temp 
             before landing a permanent job at Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And 
             following that I moved on to McKendree College, running thier 
             helpdesk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My IT career ended in 2002 when McKendree 
            went through a round of layoffs and I did not have the college 
            degree to get past HR. I say all that to give my technical 
            background as I return to talking about food. In 2013 after not 
            being able to find anything in IT, I decided to go to culinary 
            school at Southwestern Illinois College.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After greduating from culinary school I worked for 
            Peel Pizza in both thier Edwardsville and O'Fallon, IL locations. 
            I was there when the O'Fallon location opened but left in 
            December when I lost a toe due to complications from diabetes.</p>

        <h2>Restaurant Concepts</h2> 
        <article>
            <header>Larissa's Bakery</header>
            <p>This is my basic bakery with coffee which would be done in the style of a french patisserie.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <header>The Jittery Dog</header>
        <p>This was a fast casual concept that would mash up a coffee house 
            with a charcuterie (sausage) menu. The name is an illituraiton of 
            the caffiene and the hot dog style of serving the sauage.</p>
